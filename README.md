**This repository contains useful information on YAML syntax**
YAML is a superset of JSON. Which means any valid JSON file is also a valid YAML file.

YAML has two basic structures.
  . Lists
  . Maps


## YAML Maps:
Maps lets you associate Key/name and value pairs.

```
 apiVersion : v1
 kind : Pod
```

an equivalent JSON representaton is 

```
{
"apiVersion": "v1",
"kind" : "Pod"
}
```
